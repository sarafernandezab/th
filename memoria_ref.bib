abstract = {The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, are still largely unknown. Current thinking is that major gene mutations cause only a small proportion of all cases and that in most cases, non-genetic factors play a part, probably in interaction with susceptibility genes. Numerous epidemiological studies have been done to identify such non-genetic risk factors, but most were small and methodologically limited. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies have only recently reached a stage at which they have enough incident patients and person-years of follow-up to investigate possible risk factors and their interactions. In this article, we review what is known about the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of PD from epidemiological studies. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, extensive basic and clinical knowledge has been acquired on the use of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). It is now clear that mechanisms involved in the effects of this therapy are far more complex than previously anticipated. At frequencies commonly used in clinical practice, neural elements may be excited or inhibited and novel dynamic states of equilibrium are reached. Electrode contacts used for chronic DBS in PD are placed near the dorsal border of the nucleus, a highly cellular region. DBS may thus exert its effects by modulating these cells, hyperdirect projections from motor cortical areas, afferent and efferent fibers to the motor STN. Advancements in neuroimaging techniques may allow us to identify these structures optimizing surgical targeting. In this review, we provide an update on mechanisms and the neural elements modulated by STN DBS.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) has evolved from ablative procedures, within a variety of brain regions, to implantation of electrodes into specific targets of the basal ganglia. Electrode implantation surgery, referred to as deep brain stimulation (DBS), is preferred to ablative procedures by many experts owing to its reversibility, programmability, and the ability to be safely performed bilaterally. Several randomized clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of DBS surgery for control of PD symptoms. Many brain targets, including the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus, have emerged as potentially effective, with each target being closely associated with important pros and cons. Selection of appropriate PD candidates through a methodical interdisciplinary screening is considered a prerequisite for a successful surgical outcome. Despite recent growth in DBS knowledge, there is currently no consensus on the ideal surgical technique, the best surgical approach, and the most appropriate surgical target. DBS is now targeted towards treating specific PD-related symptoms in a given individual, and not simply addressing the disease with one pre-defined approach. In this review we will discuss the historical aspects of surgical treatments, the selection of an appropriate DBS candidate, the current surgical techniques, and recently introduced DBS-related technologies. We will address important pre- and postoperative issues related to DBS. We will also discuss the lessons learned from the randomized clinical studies for DBS and the shifting paradigm to tailor to a more patient-centered and symptom-specific approach.},

abstract = {Gradual degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta and subsequent reduction of dopamine levels in striatum are associated with motor deficits that characterize Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, half of the PD patients also exhibit frontostriatal-mediated executive dysfunction, including deficits in attention, short-term working memory, speed of mental processing, and impulsivity. The most commonly used treatments for PD are only partially or transiently effective and are available or applicable to a minority of patients. Because, these therapies neither restore the lost or degenerated dopaminergic neurons, nor prevent or delay the disease progression, the need for more effective therapeutics is critical. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the molecular signaling pathways involved in PD, particularly within the context of how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the initiation and progression of this disease. The involvement of molecular chaperones, autophagy-lysosomal pathways, and proteasome systems in PD are also highlighted. In addition, emerging therapies, including pharmacological manipulations, surgical procedures, stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, as well as complementary, supportive and rehabilitation therapies to prevent or delay the progression of this complex disease are reviewed.},

In Parkinson's disease, the pathological STN neuronal activity leads to motor, cognitive, and emotional inhibition. Deafferentation of the STN by DBS can reverse such behavioural inhibition. The release of this brake allows both motor and non-motor improvement, but can also be associated with excessive motor, cognitive, and emotional behavioural disinhibition. Conversely, the notable reduction in anti-parkinsonian drug dose allowed by motor improvement can unveil mesolimbic hypodopaminergic behaviours such as apathy, anxiety, or depression. Fine-tuning of stimulation parameters with dopaminergic drugs is necessary to prevent or improve pathological behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-HFS) is highly effective in treating motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and medication side effects as well as in improving quality of life. Despite preoperative screening for patients as eligible candidates for this treatment, electrode position may furthermore influence treatment quality. Here, we investigated the relationship between the anatomical site of stimulation within the MRI-defined STN and the outcome of PD patients after STN-HFS. In 30 PD patients with bilateral STN stimulation, we retrospectively defined the boundaries of the STN within the axial target plane of the stereotactic T2-weighted MRI and determined the position of the active electrode contact in relation to the border of the STN. The position of the active contact within the STN was the only variable to predict the outcome of STN stimulation. In contrast, covariates such as age, disease duration, symptom severity, and response to levodopa had no effect. The lateral position of the stimulation contact within the STN led to significantly better clinical improvement, lower stimulation parameters, and less need for postoperative dopaminergic medication. The outcome of patients with stimulation contacts within the medial region of the STN was significantly worse. Precise targeting of the lateral region of the STN is essential for achieving sufficient stimulation efficacy. Preoperative T2-weighted MRI might be a useful component of the targeting procedure to improve the outcome of PD patients.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical intervention where electrodes are permanently implanted into the brain in order to modulate pathologic neural activity. The post-operative reconstruction of the DBS electrodes is important for an efficient stimulation parameter tuning. A major limitation of existing approaches for electrode reconstruction from post-operative imaging that prevents the clinical routine use is that they are manual or semi-automatic, and thus both time-consuming and subjective. Moreover, the existing methods rely on a simplified model of a straight line electrode trajectory, rather than the more realistic curved trajectory. The main contribution of this paper is that for the first time we present a highly accurate and fully automated method for electrode reconstruction that considers curved trajectories. The robustness of our proposed method is demonstrated using a multi-center clinical dataset consisting of N = 44 electrodes. In all cases the electrode trajectories were successfully identified and reconstructed. In addition, the accuracy is demonstrated quantitatively using a high-accuracy phantom with known ground truth. In the phantom experiment, the method could detect individual electrode contacts with high accuracy and the trajectory reconstruction reached an error level below 100 $\mu$m (0.046 ± 0.025 mm). An implementation of the method is made publicly available such that it can directly be used by researchers or clinicians. This constitutes an important step towards future integration of lead reconstruction into standard clinical care.},

abstract = {Background Extracellular microelectrode recording (MER) is a prominent technique for studies of extracellular single-unit neuronal activity. In order to achieve robust results in more complex analysis pipelines, it is necessary to have high quality input data with a low amount of artifacts. We show that noise (mainly electromagnetic interference and motion artifacts) may affect more than 25{\%} of the recording length in a clinical MER database. New method We present several methods for automatic detection of noise in MER signals, based on (i) unsupervised detection of stationary segments, (ii) large peaks in the power spectral density, and (iii) a classifier based on multiple time- and frequency-domain features. We evaluate the proposed methods on a manually annotated database of 5735 ten-second MER signals from 58 Parkinson's disease patients. Comparison with existing methods The existing methods for artifact detection in single-channel MER that have been rigorously tested, are based on unsupervised change-point detection. We show on an extensive real MER database that the presented techniques are better suited for the task of artifact identification and achieve much better results. Results The best-performing classifiers (bagging and decision tree) achieved artifact classification accuracy of up to 89{\%} on an unseen test set and outperformed the unsupervised techniques by 5–10{\%}. This was close to the level of agreement among raters using manual annotation (93.5{\%}). Conclusion We conclude that the proposed methods are suitable for automatic MER denoising and may help in the efficient elimination of undesirable signal artifacts.},

abstract = {Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for motor complications in Parkinson's disease. 20 years of experience with this procedure have contributed to improved understanding of the role of the STN in motor, cognitive, and emotional control. In Parkinson's disease, the pathological STN neuronal activity leads to motor, cognitive, and emotional inhibition. Deafferentation of the STN by DBS can reverse such behavioural inhibition. The release of this brake allows both motor and non-motor improvement, but can also be associated with excessive motor, cognitive, and emotional behavioural disinhibition. Conversely, the notable reduction in anti-parkinsonian drug dose allowed by motor improvement can unveil mesolimbic hypodopaminergic behaviours such as apathy, anxiety, or depression. Fine-tuning of stimulation parameters with dopaminergic drugs is necessary to prevent or improve pathological behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Matzner2015,
abstract = {Estimation of the power spectrum is a common method for identifying oscillatory changes in neuronal activity. However, the stochastic nature of neuronal activity leads to severe biases in the estimation of these oscillations in single unit spike trains. Different biological and experimental factors cause the spike train to differentially reflect its underlying oscillatory rate function. We analyzed the effect of factors, such as the mean firing rate and the recording duration, on the detectability of oscillations and their significance, and tested these theoretical results on experimental data recorded in Parkinsonian non-human primates. The effect of these factors is dramatic, such that in some conditions, the detection of existing oscillations is impossible. Moreover, these biases impede the comparison of oscillations across brain regions, neuronal types, behavioral states and separate recordings with different underlying parameters, and lead inevitably to a gross misinterpretation of experimental results. We introduce a novel objective measure, the "modulation index", which overcomes these biases, and enables reliable detection of oscillations from spike trains and a direct estimation of the oscillation magnitude. The modulation index detects a high percentage of oscillations over a wide range of parameters, compared to classical spectral analysis methods, and enables an unbiased comparison between spike trains recorded from different neurons and using different experimental protocols.},

@article{Joshua2007,
abstract = {There have been many approaches to the problem of detection and sorting of extra-cellularly recorded action potentials, but only a few methods actually quantify the quality of this fundamental process. In most cases, the quality assessment is based on the subjective judgment of human observers and the recorded units are divided into "well isolated" or "multi-unit" groups. This subjective evaluation precludes comprehensive assessment of single-unit studies since the most basic parameter, i.e. their data quality, is not explicitly defined. Here we propose objective measures to evaluate the quality of spike data, based on the time-stamps of the detected spikes and the high-frequency sampling of the analog signal of cortical and basal-ganglia data. We show that quantification of recording quality by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may be misleading. The recording quality is better assessed by an isolation score that measures the overlap between the noise (non-spike) and the spike clusters. Furthermore, we use a nearest-neighbors algorithm to estimate the proportion of false positive and false negative classification errors. To validate these quality measures, we simulate spike detection and sorting errors and show that the scores are good predictors of the frequency of errors. The reliability of the isolation score is further verified by errors implanted in real basal ganglia data and by using different sorting algorithms. We conclude that quantitative measures of spike isolation can be obtained independently of the method used for spike detection and sorting, and recommend their reports in any study based on the activity of single neurons. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Electrical stimulation is a widely used and effective tool in systems neuroscience, neural prosthetics, and clinical neurostimulation. However, electrical artifacts evoked by stimulation significantly complicate the detection of spiking activity on nearby recording electrodes. Here, we present ERAASR: an algorithm for Estimation and Removal of Artifacts on Arrays via Sequential principal components Regression. This approach leverages the similar structure of artifact transients, but not spiking activity, across simultaneously recorded channels on the array, across pulses within a train, and across trials. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in macaque dorsal premotor cortex using acute linear multielectrode array recordings and single electrode stimulation. Large electrical artifacts appeared on all channels during stimulation. After application of ERAASR, the cleaned signals were quiescent on channels with no spontaneous spiking activity, whereas spontaneously active channels exhibited evoked spikes which closely resembled spontaneously occurring spiking waveforms. The ERAASR algorithm requires no special hardware and comprises sequential application of straightforward linear methods with intuitive parameters. Enabling simultaneous electrical stimulation and multielectrode array recording can help elucidate the causal links between neural activity and cognitive functions and enable the design and implementation of novel sensory protheses.},

abstract = {In spike-train data, bursts are considered as a unit of neural information and are of potential interest in studies of responses to any sensory stimulus. Consequently, burst detection appears to be a critical problem for which the Poisson-surprise (PS) method has been widely used for 20 years. However, this method has faced some recurrent criticism about the underlying assumptions regarding the interspike interval (ISI) distributions. In this paper, we avoid such assumptions by using a nonparametric approach for burst detection based on the ranks of ISI in the entire spike train. Similar to the PS statistic, a "Rank surprise" (RS) statistic is extracted. A new algorithm performing an exhaustive search of bursts in the spike trains is also presented. Compared to the performances of the PS method on realizations of gamma renewal processes and spike trains recorded in cat auditory cortex, we show that the RS method is very robust for any type of ISI distribution and is based on an elementary formalization of the definition of a burst. It presents an alternative to the PS method for non-Poisson spike trains and is simple to implement. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Accolla2014,
abstract = {Despite advances in understanding basic organizational principles of the human basal ganglia, accurate in vivo assessment of their anatomical properties is essential to improve early diagnosis in disorders with corticosubcortical pathology and optimize target planning in deep brain stimulation. Main goal of this study was the detailed topological characterization of limbic, associative, and motor subdivisions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in relation to corresponding corticosubcortical circuits. To this aim, we used magnetic resonance imaging and investigated independently anatomical connectivity via white matter tracts next to brain tissue properties. On the basis of probabilistic diffusion tractography we identified STN subregions with predominantly motor, associative, and limbic connectivity. We then computed for each of the nonoverlapping STN subregions the covariance between local brain tissue properties and the rest of the brain using high-resolution maps of magnetization transfer (MT) saturation and longitudinal (R1) and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). The demonstrated spatial distribution pattern of covariance between brain tissue properties linked to myelin (R1 and MT) and iron (R2*) content clearly segregates between motor and limbic basal ganglia circuits. We interpret the demonstrated covariance pattern as evidence for shared tissue properties within a functional circuit, which is closely linked to its function. Our findings open new possibilities for investigation of changes in the established covariance pattern aiming at accurate diagnosis of basal ganglia disorders and prediction of treatment outcome.

abstract = {We present a method that estimates the strength of neuronal oscillations at the cellular level, relying on autocorrelation histograms computed on spike trains. The method delivers a number, termed oscillation score, that estimates the degree to which a neuron is oscillating in a given frequency band. Moreover, it can also reliably identify the oscillation frequency and strength in the given band, independently of the oscillation in other frequency bands, and thus it can handle superimposed oscillations on multiple scales (theta, alpha, beta, gamma, etc.). The method is relatively simple and fast. It can cope with a low number of spikes, converging exponentially fast with the number of spikes, to a stable estimation of the oscillation strength. It thus lends itself to the analysis of spike-sorted single-unit activity from electrophysiological recordings. We show that the method performs well on experimental data recorded from cat visual cortex and also compares favorably to other methods. In addition, we provide a measure, termed confidence score, that determines the stability of the oscillation score estimate over trials.},

@article{Horn2015,
abstract = {To determine placement of electrodes after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, a novel toolbox that facilitates both reconstruction of the lead electrode trajectory and the contact placement is introduced. Using the toolbox, electrode placement can be reconstructed and visualized based on the electrode-induced artifacts on post-operative magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) images.Correct electrode placement is essential for efficacious treatment with DBS. Post-operative knowledge about the placement of DBS electrode contacts and trajectories is a promising tool for clinical evaluation of DBS effects and adverse effects. It may help clinicians in identifying the best stimulation contacts based on anatomical target areas and may even shorten test stimulation protocols in the future.Fifty patients that underwent DBS surgery were analyzed in this study. After normalizing the post-operative MR/CT volumes into standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-stereotactic space, electrode leads (n = 104) were detected by a novel algorithm that iteratively thresholds each axial slice and isolates the centroids of the electrode artifacts within the MR/CT-images (MR only n = 32, CT only n = 10, MR and CT n = 8). Two patients received four, the others received two quadripolar DBS leads bilaterally, summing up to a total of 120 lead localizations. In a second reconstruction step, electrode contacts along the lead trajectories were reconstructed by using templates of electrode tips that had been manually created beforehand. Reconstructions that were made by the algorithm were finally compared to manual surveys of contact localizations.The algorithm was able to robustly accomplish lead reconstructions in an automated manner in 98{\%} of electrodes and contact reconstructions in 69{\%} of electrodes. Using additional subsequent manual refinement of the reconstructed contact positions, 118 of 120 electrode lead and contact reconstructions could be localized using the toolbox.Taken together, the toolbox presented here allows for a precise and fast reconstruction of DBS contacts by proposing a semi-automated procedure. Reconstruction results can be directly exported to two- and three-dimensional views that show the relationship between DBS contacts and anatomical target regions. The toolbox is made available to the public in form of an open-source MATLAB repository.},

It is now clear that mechanisms involved in the effects of this therapy are far more complex than previously anticipated. At frequencies commonly used in clinical practice, neural elements may be excited or inhibited and novel dynamic states of equilibrium are reached. Electrode contacts used for chronic DBS in PD are placed near the dorsal border of the nucleus, a highly cellular region. DBS may thus exert its effects by modulating these cells, hyperdirect projections from motor cortical areas, afferent and efferent fibers to the motor STN. Advancements in neuroimaging techniques may allow us to identify these structures optimizing surgical targeting. In this review, we provide an update on mechanisms and the neural elements modulated by STN DBS.},

abstract = {Surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) has evolved from ablative procedures, within a variety of brain regions, to implantation of electrodes into specific targets of the basal ganglia. Electrode implantation surgery, referred to as deep brain stimulation (DBS), is preferred to ablative procedures by many experts owing to its reversibility, programmability, and the ability to be safely performed bilaterally. Several randomized clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of DBS surgery for control of PD symptoms. Many brain targets, including the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus, have emerged as potentially effective, with each target being closely associated with important pros and cons. Selection of appropriate PD candidates through a methodical interdisciplinary screening is considered a prerequisite for a successful surgical outcome. Despite recent growth in DBS knowledge, there is currently no consensus on the ideal surgical technique, the best surgical approach, and the most appropriate surgical target. DBS is now targeted towards treating specific PD-related symptoms in a given individual, and not simply addressing the disease with one pre-defined approach. In this review we will discuss the historical aspects of surgical treatments, the selection of an appropriate DBS candidate, the current surgical techniques, and recently introduced DBS-related technologies. We will address important pre- and postoperative issues related to DBS. We will also discuss the lessons learned from the randomized clinical studies for DBS and the shifting paradigm to tailor to a more patient-centered and symptom-specific approach.},
